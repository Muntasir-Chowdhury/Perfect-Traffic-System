# Perfect-Traffic-System
Hello everyone! Here I have uploaded my OpenGL project : Perfect Traffic System. The idea of the project is if I turn on the green light the vehicles will keep moving and if I turn on the red light the vehicles will stop moving.
You will see roads, grass, bus, trucks and cars are made using c++ codes.
This is an amazing demonstration of the beautiful c++ codes.
It shows how anyone can show beautiful colors and brilliant logic in a C++ project.
In order to know how this works you must have the idea about the language C++, ComputerGraphics, OpenGL. 
You can also try learning some algorithms in computer graphics from the following link, here is the link : https://www.gatevidyalay.com/dda-algorithm-line-drawing-algorithms/
The header files used :
#ifdef __APPLE__
#include <GLUT/glut.h>
#else
#include <GL/glut.h>
#endif
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
You must have Codeblocks installed in your computer.
You must import freeglut in order to run your project.

Thank you in advance.
